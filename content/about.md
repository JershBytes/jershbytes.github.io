I'm a self-taught Linux and automation nerd from Michigan in the USA. 

I've been working in DevOps for about a year now and prior to that was working in System Administration Roles. Learning Computers and technologies has been a love of mine since I can remember. This site has been built to show of my skills and document things I feel might be beneficial to me and others.
